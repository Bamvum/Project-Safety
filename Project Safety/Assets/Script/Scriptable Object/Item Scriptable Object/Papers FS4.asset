  itemDescription: The water type for a fire extinguisher only has one use and it
    is against combustible fires such as wood, paper, and other kinds of textiles.
    Effective only against Class A fires. It works by soaking the fire and materials
    in water, removing the heat and cooling the fire significantly so it can no longer
    burn.
