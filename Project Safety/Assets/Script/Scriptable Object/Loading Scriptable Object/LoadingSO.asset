  - "Many people think that the flames are what cause damage, injuries, and deaths
    during a fire. However, smoke inhalation is a common concern with fires. You
    don\u2019t even have to come in contact with the flames for fire to cause harm.
    Smoke inhalation and smoke damage are serious dangers that are often overlooked."
  - Plugging several high-energy devices into a socket is asking for trouble and
    has been the source of a fire countless times. Share your devices as much as
    you can between different sockets in order to minimise the risk of overheating.
  - Arson can sound like the type of thing that only happens on television, but it
    is not uncommon within both domestic and non domestic premises. Disgruntled employees,

    reasons to stay extremely vigilant as a business.
