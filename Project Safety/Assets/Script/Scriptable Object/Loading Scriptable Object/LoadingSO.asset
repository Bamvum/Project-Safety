  - "Many people think that the flames are what cause damage, injuries, and deaths
    during a fire. However, smoke inhalation is a common concern with fires. You
    don\u2019t even have to come in contact with the flames for fire to cause harm.
    Smoke inhalation and smoke damage are serious dangers that are often overlooked."
  - Plugging several high-energy devices into a socket is asking for trouble and
    has been the source of a fire countless times. Share your devices as much as
    you can between different sockets in order to minimise the risk of overheating.
  - Arson can sound like the type of thing that only happens on television, but it
    is not uncommon within both domestic and non domestic premises. Disgruntled employees,
    employees who have been arsonists in the past and unwittingly employed are both
    reasons to stay extremely vigilant as a business.
  - CO2, or carbon dioxide, is not only a common gas but also an effective tool for
    fighting Class B and C fires. When used in fire extinguishers, it's highly pressurized
    and loaded with non-flammable gas, making it perfect for tackling fires involving
    flammable liquids and electrical equipment.
  - Wet chemical extinguishers, identified by their yellow label, are specially designed
    for Class K and A fires. They contain a potassium-based solution that cools the
    fire by spraying a fine mist, preventing it from spreading. Perfect for kitchen
    fires and other high-risk areas!
  - Water extinguishers are highly effective for Class A fires, which involve ordinary
    combustibles like wood and paper. They soak up the materials that are on fire
    removing its heat and it cools off.
  - Foam extinguishers, marked with a cream label, are ideal for Class A and B fires.
    They create a thick cooling blanket that seals burning materials, preventing
    the fire from reigniting. These extinguishers are perfect for schools, warehouses,
    and buildings made from organic materials.
  - Dry powder extinguishers, marked with a blue label, are specifically designed
    to fight Class D fires, which involve combustible metals. While highly effective
    in industrial settings with chemical operations, the powder can be hazardous
    if inhaled, so extra care is needed when using them.
  - Dry chemical extinguishers are effective against Class A, B, and C fires! They
    use a non-toxic powder to quickly suppress flames, making them an excellent choice
    for homes, offices, and industrial settings alike. A versatile safety tool for
    various fire hazards.
